# Guess Number ğŸ”¢
# CodÃ©dex

# Initialize guess to 0 (arbitrary number not equal to 6)

# Initialize tries to count how many attempts the user makes
tries = 0

# Loop continues while the guess is wrong AND the user has tries left

    guess = int(input("Guess the number: "))

    # Increase the try count by 1

# After the loop ends, check if the guess was correct
